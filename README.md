### Hi there 👋
I'm Marin and I code 👨‍💻, and ocasionally gaze at the stars 🔭!

Welcome to 
- 💼 I’m currently working on [Arduino Workshop](https://github.com/marinmaslov/arduino-workshop)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyze a star's spectrum

- ⚡ Fun fact: Every star ⭐ you see in the night sky is bigger and brighter than our sun.
