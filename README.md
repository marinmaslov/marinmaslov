### Hi there 👋
#### I'm Marin, I code 👨‍💻 and ocasionally gaze at the stars 🔭!

- 💼 I’m currently working on [Arduino Workshop](https://github.com/marinmaslov/arduino-workshop)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyze a star's spectrum

- ⚡ Fun fact: Every star ⭐ you see in the night sky is bigger and brighter than our sun.
